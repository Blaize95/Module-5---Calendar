This workday schedule tracker was created by combining HTML, CSS, Javascript and 3rd Party API's including: Bootstrap and DayJS. It is designed to track the hours within a regular working day and display when a particular time block is 'past', 'present', or 'future'. The application allows users to save input text for each time block - which is saved to local storage and retrievable apon refresh or reponening the page.
